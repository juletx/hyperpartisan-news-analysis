Hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers have been laid off as a result. American manufacturers say, however, that in order to stay competitive in the global economy they need to keep costs low. The most efficient way to do that is to hire cheap foreign labor. Carrier Corp was looking to follow this formula to keep profit margins in the green.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The jobs at Carrier Corp. are on the way to Mexico because the company concluded that it could not stay competitive and reward its shareholders unless it took advantage of lower production costs south of the border,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-trump-carrier-20161128-story.html\" type=\"external\">reports</a> CNBC. &#8220;Things are as simple as that&#8230;&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But Trump (or Mike Pence, who is still the governor of Indiana) managed to work his magic and convince Carrier&#8217;s parent company, UTC, to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana where manufacturing jobs have been hemorrhaging for decades.</p> \\n\\n<p>Promising a combination of tax relief and regulation easing, Trump made an offer UTC couldn&#8217;t refuse. Left-wing economic populists like Bernie Sanders pushed Trump to make Carrier stay in the United States, suggesting that it was something the Trumpian right and labor left could agree on. Rather than incentivizing the conglomerate, Sanders and his allies were looking to use UTC&#8217;s multi-billionaire business relationship with the Pentagon as leverage. While Trump had promised to deploy similarly coercive tactics, such as high tariffs and penalties on companies that ship jobs abroad, he ultimately took a free market approach to the problem.</p> \\n\\n<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump called out Carrier by name and used the air conditioning company as an example of the worker unfriendly economic environment the United States has become.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;From the earliest days of his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per\" type=\"external\">Donald J. Trump</a> made keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and the decision by Carrier, the big air-conditioner company, to move 2,000 of them from Indiana to Mexico was a tailor-made talking point for him on the stump,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html?smid=tw-share\" type=\"external\">explains</a> The New York Times.</p> \\n\\n<p>Championing a populist economic message, Trump vowed to keep more jobs here in the United States. While technology will likely continue replacing manufacturing jobs at a much faster rate than foreign labor ever could, the billionaire businessman&#8217;s Carrier deal is a symbolic victory for the &#8220;America first&#8221; Trump movement.</p> \\n\\n<p>Without a doubt, it&#8217;s a good way to start a presidency. However, there&#8217;s only so much the federal government can do to alleviate the economic hardship of the Rust Belt, America&#8217;s manufacturing heartland. The steamboat of globalization and technological innovation cannot be tamed, let alone reversed. In short, there won&#8217;t be a manufacturing renaissance.

They&#8217;re armed with seeds, soil and a range of gardening tools. Upside-down soda bottles, filled with water, outline a series of rectangular garden plots. A boy named Felipy Pigato tells me they are preparing the soil for planting.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Yesterday we mixed regular soil with coconut fiber,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The coconut fiber holds the seeds in the soil.&#8221; &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Today, he says they will add in the compost. As the students dig, they pull back chunks of dirt, creating shallow pits, where earthworms wriggle in the freshly dug soil.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Mateus Feitosa de Almeida, 12, slowly pulls back the soil around a worm. &#8220;We have to pull like that so we don&#8217;t hurt the worms,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;If we take them out, it&#8217;s bad for the soil.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>This digging is going on in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, in a garden that belongs to Le&#227;o Machado School, a large public school.</p> \\n\\n<p>The students are working under the guidance of two teachers, Daniel Giglio Colombo and Marta Martins.</p> \\n\\n<p>This is the second year of the project, says Colombo, who helped start the garden. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to grow the same things we did last year &#8212; arugula, lettuce, radishes.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The vegetables they grow are used in school meals. But the real aim of the school garden is not to supply ingredients, he says, but to teach students where food comes from, so they can develop a connection to their food.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;When we ask students where lettuce comes from, they say the market,&#8221; Colombo says. &#8220;They have lost contact with nature, the soil, sowing, and growing of crops.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>And that is reflected in their diets, he says, which are increasingly unhealthy.</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>Students say the school garden project is teaching them a lot about how to grow food, though it\\'s still hard for some of them to appreciate vegetables.</p> \\n\\n<p>Rhitu Chatterjee</p> \\n\\n<p>Just like in the US, highly processed foods like fast food, soda, and high-fructose corn syrup have become all too popular here in Brazil. And obesity rates are rising, even among children. It is a nation-wide problem that has alarmed the government and public health experts in the country.&amp;#160;Brazil&#8217;s government has banned sodas, cakes&amp;#160;and cookies in school meals. It has restricted the amount of salt and sugar in them as well. It also requires at least one daily serving of fruits and vegetables.</p> \\n\\n<p>Initially, students used to reject fresh food, says Martins. She and her colleagues hoped that the school garden would change that.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to create better habits with this project,&#8221; Martins says. &#8220;We wanted them to improve their eating and become healthier.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>That idea is behind flourishing school gardens across Brazil. The program started 12 years ago as a pilot program in five schools, as part of a project by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Program. Today, there are a few thousand school gardens in 700 cities and towns. Many are run independently by schools. Others are supported by city governments.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to know yet whether school gardens have improved children&#8217;s health, says Albaneide Peixinho, who ran Brazil&#8217;s school meal program for 13 years. But she says schools are reporting that the gardens have made students more aware of their food.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;With school gardens, they see that food comes from the Earth,&#8221; Peixinho says, and they are eating healthier. Some studies even show that the students are influencing how their families eat. &#8220;Parents say that the kids are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, and they insist on eating those foods at home.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>Sarah Campos (left) and Juliana Santos, former students of&amp;#160;the Le&#227;o Machado School.
